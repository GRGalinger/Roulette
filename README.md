# Roulette
Program to simulate an electronic roulettle table game. In this game, the house and the player each get a ball to place in the wheel. The player will make a minimum bet then release their ball in the wheel to find where it stops. The player can then look at her results and increase the wager by a maximum of double the original wager if they choose. The house will then release their its ball. The player wins only if her ball lands on a spot that has a larger value than the house (house wins all ties). The game is over when the player chooses to stop or runs out of money.
